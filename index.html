                <p>My super power is tenacity! I have always been extremely driven and goal-oriented. I am always seeking to learn new information that can help take my career to the next level. I am interested in taking the Web Programming course with Tech901 because of my amazing experience with IT Foundations. The instructors were well-versed and extremely welcoming. In my current job role, one of my job duties entails setting up websites for real estate agents. I would love to have the skills and knowledge to create the very websites that I see and work with on a daily basis. <p>
